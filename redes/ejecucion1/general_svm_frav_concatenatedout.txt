In this file are the results of using casia architecture and FRAV image database
In the architecture conv, pool, response normalization,fully connect, dropout and softmax layers are used with relu. No strides are used
The configuration of the net is learning_rate=0.001, n_epochs=400, nkerns=[96, 256, 386, 384, 256], batch_size=20
Early stop has been deleted
For training has been used softmax classifier and for testing softmax and SVM
In this example, two classes are going to be used, class 0 for real users and class 1 for attacks
